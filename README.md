## Intro

Xpenses will be a wallets-based expense tracker. Each wallet represents a different context for spending money with its own expenses.  
Let's say you have just bought a new house and you need to keep track of your expenses until you get financially stable, because that house was expensive. That's where Xpenses got in! You'll create a wallet for your bills to pay with a maximum value to spend, then some expenses to fill that wallet. Same thing with your games and your little pet.

## Technologies

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for language and runtime;
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to set up the server and its features;
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for ORM;
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database;
- Will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing features;
